(Reuters / John Kolesidis) " /> <p> The annual march comes as Greece reels from its sixth year of recession. European Union and International Monetary Fund (IMF) lenders are set to begin a new round of talks to decide whether to throw more money at the southern European nation.  </p><p> The crowd gathered in front of parliament in Syntagma Square, waving banners which read, “<i>IMF, EU out!,”</i> in reference to the bailouts that Greece has received from both bodies in return for harsh austerity measures. <br></p><p> The crowd shouted, “<i>Don’t bow your heads</i>” and “<i>Never again fascism</i>,” in reference to the military rule which took place between 1967 and 1974. </p><p> </p><p> After rallying in Syntagma Square, the thousands of protesters made their way to the US embassy. Many believe the US privately backed the Greek army which rose to power in 1967. <br><br> The 1973 Athens Polytechnic uprising protested against the rule of the Greek military junta which ruled from 1967-1974. The junta aimed to control every aspect of politics in Greece. It also forcibly drafted students into the military, thereby creating anti-junta sentiments among students. <br></p><div class="cont-wp advance-extra"> <blockquote class="col-med flright"> <p> <b>February 21, 1973:</b> Law students barricaded themselves inside the University of Athens, demanding that the law forcing students to go into the army be abolished. This was seen as a prelude to the uprising. <br><b>November 14, 1973:</b> Students from Athens Polytechnic University also went on strike, barricading themselves inside buildings and broadcasting to the populace using a homemade radio transmitter. <br><b>November 17, 1973:</b> The transitional government sent a tank crashing through the university gates. Twenty-four civilians were killed. <br><b>November 25, 1973:</b> Military law was reinstated. <br><b>July 1974:</b> The military regime imploded, ushering in a new era. <br></p> </blockquote> </div><p> The country’s bailout has come at a very heavy price for the majority of Greeks. Citizens have experienced tax hikes alongside cuts in their wages and pensions. Unemployment has soared to record levels. Six in 10 young people in Greece are currently out of work, and homelessness is also increasing. <br></p><p> “<i>People here are suffering – we can’t go any lower. We’re at our limits and the kids have no future so they’re leaving,”</i> 48-year-old biologist Athena Pantra told Reuters at the rally.  </p><p> <i>“The troika should leave not them,</i>” she added, referring to the trio of lenders which have kept Greece afloat and in the eurozone. </p><p> But an independent Greek politician told Reuters that Greeks would be better off without the troika’s cash.  </p><p> <i>“We will continue the struggle for bread, education and freedom. In order to abolish the bailout, kick out the troika from our country and regain Greece</i>,” he said. </p><p> Seven-thousand police officers were on hand - prepared for violence or rioting - although the protests were largely peaceful. </p><p> However, in the port city of Patras, police fired teargas at around 200 demonstrators who hurled rocks and petrol bombs at the offices of the far-right Golden Dawn party. The government has cracked down on Golden Dawn since the openly fascist organization killed an anti-fascist rapper in September. <br></p><p> <br></p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/kazan-crash-live-updates-876/</guid><title><![CDATA[Kazan plane crash: LIVE UPDATES]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/kazan-crash-live-updates-876/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/21/2c/40/00/kazan-2.jpg" title="RIA Novosti / Roman Antonov"/><pubDate>Sun, 17 Nov 2013 22:29:50 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/21/2c/40/00/kazan-2.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Fifty people died as a Boeing passenger plane crashed in the city of Kazan in central Russia on Saturday.

So long as we are not certain that Iran has renounced nuclear arms, we will keep in place all our demands and sanctions,”</i> Hollande said during a welcoming ceremony at Tel Aviv’s airport at the beginning of his three-day visit to Israel. </p><p> The French president’s words give support to an intense campaign by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to toughen the terms of a proposed nuclear deal with Iran ahead of the third round of talks in Geneva this week. <br><br> But Iranian policymaker and scholar Seyed Hossein Mousavian told RT that France is blocking a peaceful deal because of unfounded claims by Israel. <br><br><i>“France has blocked the peaceful deal because of Israeli claims. I think this is a historical mistake France is making. It was for twenty years they [Israel] are saying that Iran will possess a nuclear bomb within one year, or two years, therefore it has been proven to the international community that the Israelis are lying,”</i> he said. <br><br> Iran will likely be the most important subject on the agenda during talks between the Israeli and French leaders. Israel praised France for taking a tough line against Iran during the last round of negotiations on November 7-8. Meanwhile, Tehran has accused Paris of deliberately blocking an agreement. <br></p><p> </p><p> Netanyahu has slammed a proposal to be discussed during the talks - which will resume November 20-23 - whereby economic sanctions on Tehran will be eased if Iran suspends part of its nuclear program. <br><br> Netanyahu, known for his lack of tolerance and harsh stance towards the Iranian regime, believes that current measures must not only remain in place, but be strengthened until Iran has dismantled all of its uranium enrichment program. He maintains that until this happens, Iran will have the capability of developing a nuclear bomb. <br><br> Certain voices in US Congress are also pushing for tougher sanctions against Iran. Proposed legislation to impose new sanctions could arrive on the Senate floor next week. <br><br> US President Barack Obama has urged US lawmakers not to impose new sanctions on Iran while talks are still ongoing. Meanwhile, Secretary of State John Kerry has stirred controversy in Israel by accusing Tel Aviv of overreacting to the proposed deal.    <br><br> However, Netanyahu has said that the disagreement with the US is a minor one. <br><br><i>“John Kerry is an old friend of mine and is also a friend of Israel. I want to clarify that even among the best of friends there can be disagreements, certainly on matters that concern our future and our destiny,”</i> he said. <br><br> A senior US official remained upbeat on the negotiations, stating on Friday that a deal can be reached with Iran.   <br><br><i>“For the first time in nearly a decade, we are getting close to a first step that would stop the Iranian nuclear program from advancing and roll it back in key areas,”</i> the official told reporters. <br><br> In comments broadcast on Saturday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that a preliminary agreement with Iran was near. <br></p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/iran-nuclear-talks-deal-869/</guid><title><![CDATA[Tehran’s ‘right’ to enrich uranium need not be recognized by other nations – Iranian FM]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/iran-nuclear-talks-deal-869/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/21/2b/d0/00/uranium.jpg" title="A cameraman films inside the Isfahan Uranium Conversion Facilities (UCF), 420 kms south of Tehran (AFP Photo / Behrouz Mehri) "/><pubDate>Sun, 17 Nov 2013 20:00:01 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/21/2b/d0/00/uranium.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />In what could be a way around the main sticking point in negotiations between Tehran and the six world powers, Iran has stated that other nations need not recognize its right to enrich uranium. The statement was made by Iran's foreign minister.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/21/2b/d0/00/uranium.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="A cameraman films inside the Isfahan Uranium Conversion Facilities (UCF), 420 kms south of Tehran (AFP Photo / Behrouz Mehri) " /> <p> Western diplomats have said that one the main problems during the negotiations earlier this month was Iran’s insistence that it has the <i>“right”</i> to enrich uranium. </p><p> <i>“Not only do we consider that Iran’s right to enrich is non-negotiable, but we see no need for that to be recognized as ‘a right,’ because this right is inalienable and all countries must respect that,”</i> Mohammad Javad Zarif told ISNA news agency. </p><p> The US maintains that Iran does not intrinsically have that right under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. </p><p> Uranium enrichment is the most sensitive area surrounding Iran’s nuclear program. Enriching uranium to 20 percent means it can be used in nuclear medicines and for reactor fuel. It must be enriched to 90 percent in order to be used for a nuclear bomb. </p><p> Iran has repeatedly denied that it is seeking to build nuclear weapons. However, experts say that its enrichment facilities and stockpiles of enriched uranium far outweigh what it needs for medical and civilian purposes.<span> </span> </p><p> Tehran is currently in talks in Geneva with the P5 +1 group, which includes the US, Britain, France, China, Russia, and Germany – all of which support the curbing of Iran’s nuclear program. </p><p> Negotiations on November 7-8 appeared to be close to clinching a deal and ending the 10-year dispute, but a last minute objection from France stopped an agreement from being reached. </p><p> Iranian media blamed France for the lack of a deal, stating that the French were playing to Israeli interests. </p><p> Nevertheless, both sides have agreed to return to the negotiating table on November 20. </p><p> </p><p> Zarif says he is keen to reach a deal. <i>“We want to reach an agreement and understanding,”</i> he said. </p><p> The P5+1 countries are urging Iran to give concrete assurances that its nuclear program will not be used to build atomic bombs. </p><p> Tehran wants relief from western sanctions which have crippled its economy and driven up inflation. The sanctions have caused Iran’s oil revenue and currency both to slump. </p><p> The exact details of the negotiations are unknown, but the West wants tighter inspections, for Iran to halt its uranium enrichment, and for it to close a reactor which could produce plutonium for nuclear bombs. </p><p> <i>“We have reached a very sensitive stage of negotiations, and this stage we do not want to get into the details. It is necessary for them [the West] to lift the sanctions and economic pressures they have put on the people of Iran. We are moving in that direction,”</i> said Zarif. </p><p> The US has said that if Iran stops enriching uranium and gives International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors full access to its nuclear facilities, then there will be some relief from sanctions. But Washington says the core sanctions should remain in place so they can be cranked up again if Iran reneges on any deal. </p><h2> US and West being ‘untrustworthy’ </h2><p> Iranian political analyst Seyed Mohammad Marandi told RT that Iran had been very “reasonable” in its negotiations with the West in Geneva, and said the American side had been <i>“discredited.”</i> </p><p> <i>“The American side was discredited because the Americans agreed to one thing and then when the French came and changed the whole text, the Americans changed their position,”</i> he said, adding that State Secretary Kerry had the audacity to <i>“claim that it was the Iranians at fault.”</i> </p><p> <i>“It showed both to the Iranian public and the international community that the problem never lied with Iran and it was really the West that has been dishonest and has been trying to deprive the Iranian people of their rights,”</i> Marandi told RT. </p><p> But the US said immediately after the talks collapsed that it was Iran that backed out of the negotiations. </p><p> US Secretary of State John Kerry said that <i>“at that particular moment,”</i> Iran had been unable to accept a deal. </p><p> He also played down differences in the Western camp, saying, <i>“The French signed off on it; we signed off on it.”</i> </p><p> Experts say that progress between Iran and the IAEA is crucial to the end outcome and a vital parallel to the talks themselves. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/passenger-plane-crash-kazan-866/</guid><title><![CDATA[50 dead as passenger jet crashes in central Russia (PHOTOS,VIDEO)]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/passenger-plane-crash-kazan-866/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/21/2b/a0/00/photo.jpg" title="Site of Kazan jet crash (Image by Russia's Emergencies Ministry)"/><pubDate>Sun, 17 Nov 2013 16:01:24 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/21/2b/a0/00/photo.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Fifty people died after a Boeing passenger plane crashed while landing in the city of Kazan in central Russia on Saturday, according to the Emergencies Ministry.

The jet’s nose reportedly hit the ground during touchdown. Flight U363 was coming from Moscow Domodedovo airport. <br></p><p> Initially, 44 fatalities were reported in the crash.

Now they are looking for flight data recorders.  <br></p><p> </p><p> According to reports on social media, taxi drivers in Kazan are taking the victims' relatives to and from the airport free of charge. <br></p><p> The passenger jet caught on fire after the crash landing. The flames were extinguished less than one hour into the disaster. <br></p><p> “<i>Only ashes and pieces of foam were left from the plane [after the explosion]</i>,” a doctor from the emergency rescue team told ITAR-TASS. <br></p><p> Kazan is the eighth most populous city in Russia. Located 800km to the east of Moscow, it’s the capital of the largely-Muslim Republic of Tatarstan. <br></p><p> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/f4d5BEOJbSY" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe> <br></p><h2> 'One of fuel tanks detonated' <br> </h2><p> An emergency services source told Interfax that the pilots apparently made some mistake when entering the second lap. <br></p><p> “<i>The plane attempted to land several times. One of the [fuel] tanks detonated while the plane was landing,</i>” said Emergencies Ministry spokeswoman Irina Rossius.  <br></p><p> One of the reasons behind the crash could have been low-quality fuel, the Investigative Committee believes. “<i>We ordered to take samples of the fuel that was used to fill up the aircraft in Moscow,”</i> a senior official told ITAR-TASS. <br></p><p> <span>The crew reported 500 meters before hitting the runway that the machinery was not ready for landing, an unnamed source told Interfax. According to another report, the plane is believed to have touched the ground with its wing when landing, said a representative of the Investigation Committee, as cited by RIA Novosti.</span> <br></p><p> A witness traveling from Kazan to Moscow, who happened to be on the airfield at the moment of the crash, told RT that he heard a loud bang and felt some trembling. The shuttle bus he was on was then diverted back to the terminal. The young man did not report any panic and said that he and other passengers were allowed to pick up their luggage within about 15 minutes after the crash. <br></p><p> A criminal case into the violation of flight rules has been initiated. The Interstate Aviation Committee is dispatching its experts to look into the accident. Russian President Vladimir Putin has instructed the government to form a commission to investigate the cause of the plane crash in Kazan, said presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov.  </p><p> </p><h2> Causes under review: Pilot error, technical failure, weather </h2><p> The Investigation Committee has launched a probe into the crash. The head of the committee, Vladimir Markin, said the crash might have been caused by pilot error, technical malfunction, or weather conditions. <br></p><p> According to local reports, there were high winds and cloudy skies over the airport in central Russia. Temperatures were above zero. <br></p><p> An expert on air accidents, first-class pilot Vladimir Gerasimov told RT he suspects “<i>an apparent crew error</i>,” as the plane failed to make a precise landing approach on the first try. However, this can be verified only after the flight data recorder of the crashed plane is analyzed, he added. <br></p><p> </p><p> The weather conditions were favorable for landing, argued sources in the Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring of Russia. <br></p><p> “<i>The visibility was five thousand meters, the runway was dry. You cannot even imagine better conditions</i>,” said an employee from the federal service, adding that it is unlikely that bad weather caused the crash. </p><p> Probes are expected to start on Monday morning. <br></p><h2> 'Boeing 737-500 caused trouble before' <br> </h2><p> The Boeing 737-500 is a make of a popular short- to medium-range twin-engine jet airliner, which was introduced in 1987. The series is also known as “Classic,” along with the 300 and the 400 models. The 737-500 can seat from 108 to 132 passengers and has two cockpit crew members.   </p><p> The jet that crashed in Kazan - tail number VQ-BBN - was released in 1990. The Tatarstan airline bought the plane in December 2008. <br></p><p> This is not the first time that the aircraft has experienced problems. Just last year, the plane made an emergency landing at the same terminal, a law enforcement source told Interfax. The flight was headed to Moscow, but the plane made an emergency landing. Twenty minutes after takeoff, alarm sensors were reportedly triggered due to depressurization of the cabin. None of the 78 people on board were injured.  </p><p> The crashed Boeing has been in service for 23 years,the airlines spokesperson told ITAR-TASS.

Since the search giant began sharing the statistics in 2010, requests have rocketed from 12,539 in the last half of 2009 to 25,879 in the first six months of 2013.<span> </span> </p><p> “<i>This comes as usage of our services continues to grow, but also as more governments have made requests than ever before. And these numbers only include the requests we’re allowed to publish</i>,” the company said in a blog post. </p><p> The US continues to lead the list, with 10,918 requests concerning some 21,863 American users and accounts between January and June 2013. Google said it handed over data for 83 percent of those requests, which marked the highest rate in its query-comply rate.<span> </span> </p><p> India, the second on the list, is lagging behind the leader with 2,691 requests about 4,161 users and accounts, the biannual reports shows. However, the country’s population is actually three times as large as the US's. </p><p> Germany comes third, with Google receiving 2,311 requests from the European state; it complied with 48 percent of them. France is rounding out in the top four snoopers, having asked the tech giant for users’ data 2,011 times and having its curiosity satisfied in 49 percent of cases.<span> </span> </p><p> Russia is ranked 21st and made 103 requests about 103 accounts and users. Google complied with none of those, according to the report. </p><p> </p><p> Google says that over the past three years it has kept adding more detail to their reports. They now include “additional information about the legal process for US criminal requests: breaking out emergency disclosures, wiretap orders, pen register orders and other court orders”. </p><p> The American giant slammed US authorities for preventing it from sharing full information on the requests it receives from the government with the public . </p><p> “<i>The US Department of Justice contends that US law does not allow us to share information about some national security requests that we might receive. Specifically, the US government argues that we cannot share information about the requests we receive (if any) under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act,</i>” Google says in its official blog. </p><p> Data on requests made under the FISA is missing from the report – that graph provided in the blog post is completely blacked out. FISA requests refer to court orders that can require American companies to hand over personal information in national security investigations. </p><p> Google also receives the so-called National Security Letters – requests authorized by the FBI which can require companies to deliver subscribers’ name, address, length of service, and local and long distance toll billing records. That data – also used for national security investigations - does not require a court order. In its report, Google has so far shared only general information regarding these letters, basically saying that the number of them was within the range of between 0 and 999. </p><p> The company vowed that it will continue to defend users’ data “from overly broad government requests, and to push for greater transparency around the world”. </p><p> Google’s latest report covers mainly the period before the global spying scandal, which unravelled after the former National Security Agency’s contractor, Edward Snowden, disclosed information about PRISM - the secret American surveillance program. The revelation was followed by a string of spy scandals around the globe, with the whistleblower having leaked up to 200,000 classified American documents. Perhaps these revelations will give governments pause for thought and make them think about curbing their appetites for snooping. </p><p> <br></p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/gchq-hotel-diplomat-spying-853/</guid><title><![CDATA[GCHQ snoops on hotel reservations targeting diplomats – Snowden leaks]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/gchq-hotel-diplomat-spying-853/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/21/2a/d0/00/gchq-hotel-diplomat-spying-.jpg" title="Reuters / Kiyoshi Ota"/><pubDate>Sun, 17 Nov 2013 14:42:13 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/21/2a/d0/00/gchq-hotel-diplomat-spying-.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A UK spy agency infiltrated international hotel booking systems for some three years, tracing high profile officials and wiretapping their suites, new leaks reveal. GCHQ’s top secret ‘Royal Concierge’ program tracked 350 hotels across the globe.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/21/2a/d0/00/gchq-hotel-diplomat-spying-.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Kiyoshi Ota" /> <p> Germany’s Der Spiegel has published yet another episode of scandalous revelations from the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, currently enjoying temporary asylum in Moscow. <br></p><p> Constantly on the move, top officials and diplomats prefer to stay in high-end establishments and boutique hotels with premier service standards. And since the number of high-class hotels in the world is finite, British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) came up with the idea of turning them into a huge net to fish for secrets in high-tech style. <br></p><p> After the ‘Royal Concierge’ program underwent testing in 2010, it was readied and put into action. <br></p><p> Documents unearthed by Snowden reveal that over a three-year period GCHQ had an automatic system for singling out people of interest, who made reservations in about 350 upscale hotels worldwide. <br></p><p> Field operatives then allegedly wiretapped the phone and network cables inside the targetted suite, and were potentially able to check into the next door suite in order to eavesdrop the target at the scene. <br></p><h2> ‘Royal Concierge’ in operation <br> </h2><p> According to documents seen by Der Spiegel, when a top official or a diplomat makes a reservation using his working e-mail address (or his secretary does) with a governmental domain like .gov, GCHQ gets a notification and decides whether it needs to take ‘action’ or not. <br><br> Once a foreign diplomat is booked into a hotel, putting him under the microscope becomes a purely technical objective. Der Spiegel lists an impressive array of spying techniques and capabilities “that seem to exhaust the creative potential of modern spying”. No details, however, are provided. <br><br> On occasions, when a guest of special interest checks in, a crack intellgence unit can be deployed who have 'specialist technologies' for spying at their disposal. GCHQ may also put into action codename 'Humint' [Human Intelligence], for close scrutiny of the target, an operation that could also include field agents working in the vicinity.  </p><p> </p><p> Der Spiegel also highlights the speculation that ‘Royal Concierge’ could possibly manipulate hotel choices through the booking programs and also bug hired cars. <br><br> Der Spiegel has not provided information about whether ‘Royal Concierge’ has been spying on Britain’s major allies, or if the targets of the GCHQ hotel surveillance had any connections to Al-Qaeda. <br><br> Remarkably, the report comes right after British intelligence chiefs made assurances that their actions were conducted within the framework of the war on terror. At a November-7th hearing by parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee in London, GCHQ head, Sir Ian Lobban, acknowledged that Edward Snowden’s leaks would make GCHQ’s work “far harder” for years to come. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/hagel-cuts-defense-military-857/</guid><title><![CDATA[Pentagon head laments ‘too steep, too deep’ US budget cuts]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/hagel-cuts-defense-military-857/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/21/2b/10/00/hagel-cuts-defense-military.jpg" title="AFP Photo"/><pubDate>Sun, 17 Nov 2013 13:10:57 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/21/2b/10/00/hagel-cuts-defense-military.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has sounded an alarm bell about the budget cuts he says threaten America's security and global military role. The cuts are set to amount to almost $1 trillion for the Department of Defense over a decade.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/21/2b/10/00/hagel-cuts-defense-military.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="AFP Photo" /> <p> In the fiscal year of 2014, automatic cuts of about $52 billion represent about 10 percent of the Pentagon budget. Hagel called the cuts "<i>too steep, too deep and too abrupt.</i>" <br></p><p> "<i>This is an irresponsible way to govern, and it forces the department into a very bad set of choices</i>," the Defense Secretary added speaking at the Ronald Reagan Defense Forum in California. <br></p><p> The US Navy’s global presence is down 10 percent this year; the Army cancelled training rotations for 15 percent of the military, and the Air Force cut down on 25 percent of its training events. <br></p><p> "<i>The effects will be felt for a long period of time to come. By continuing to cancel training for non-deploying personnel, we will create a backlog of training requirements that could take years to recover from,</i>" Hagel also said at the California event. <br></p><p> Defense Secretary Hagel warned that if a deal is not reached to stave off the deepest cuts, US forces might not be ready if another major conflict erupts unexpectedly. <br></p><p> "<i>In effect, we would be gambling that we will not face a major contingency operation against a capable adversary in the near-term,"</i> Hagel said. <br></p><p> The budget crisis – and the ensuing cuts – came as the US military was drawing back after more than a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan that followed the September 11, 2001 attacks, AP reported.  </p><p> The inability of Republicans and Democrats to agree on solutions to economic problems led to the sequestration of the state budget in March. By the end of the fiscal year the budget had been slashed by $ 85 billion, while half of the cuts were imposed on the Pentagon, reducing funding for America’s defense. <br><br> Because of the cuts the US Army was forced to cancel six months of military training, said Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno in October. Officials are planning to  scale down the military, cutting the number of brigades from 45 to 33, while only two of them are <a href="http://rt.com/usa/us-military-cuts-problems-536/" target="_blank">fully-trained</a> brigades comprising of 3,500 to 5,000 soldiers. <br><br> The cuts also forced the US Air Force to <a href="http://rt.com/usa/air-force-aircraft-ground-119/" target="_blank">ground</a> about one-third of its active-duty combat aircraft in April, which included squadrons of fighters, bombers, and airborne warning and control crafts. <br><br> The next sequester is expected to take place in January and it could potentially see the Defense Department’s budget cut by $21 billion. <br></p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/glonass-usa-monitoring-stations-847/</guid><title><![CDATA[Spy fears: CIA, Pentagon ‘work against’ Russia building GLONASS station in US]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/glonass-usa-monitoring-stations-847/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/21/2a/70/00/glonass-usa-monitoring-stations-.jpg" title="Inauguration of the first monitoring station of Russia's GLONASS global navigation system outside of Russia, on the University of Brasilia campus in Brasilia (Reuters / Fabio Rodrigues-Pozzebom) (RT's archive footage of GLONASS satellite assembly facility in Krasnoyarsk)"/><pubDate>Sun, 17 Nov 2013 10:36:09 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/21/2a/70/00/glonass-usa-monitoring-stations-.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />US intelligence and military are pressing the State Department not to license construction of monitor stations for Russia’s GLONASS navigation system on US territory, media reveals. The stations reportedly spark fears of spying opportunities.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/21/2a/70/00/glonass-usa-monitoring-stations-.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Inauguration of the first monitoring station of Russia's GLONASS global navigation system outside of Russia, on the University of Brasilia campus in Brasilia (Reuters / Fabio Rodrigues-Pozzebom) (RT's archive footage of GLONASS satellite assembly facility in Krasnoyarsk)" /> <p> Moscow sent a request to build monitor stations for GLONASS, a Russian satellite system similar to GPS, on US territory in May 2012. <br></p><p> The White House has been pondering over the proposal ever since. A number of meetings between Russian and American authorities on the GLONASS monitor stations in the US have taken place, but so far US security and military agencies have not agreed about how to react to Moscow’s request. <br></p><p> The CIA and Pentagon suspect that such stations could be used for collecting intelligence data and other military purposes, like collecting exact coordinates of covert facilities in the US for precision missile guidance, a weekend report in The New York Times revealed. <br></p><p> “<i>In recent months, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Pentagon have been quietly waging a campaign to stop the State Department from allowing Roscosmos… to build about half a dozen of these structures, known as monitor stations, on United States soil</i>,” the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/world/europe/a-russian-gps-using-us-soil-stirs-spy-fears.html?hp&amp;_r=2&amp;" target="_blank">report</a> alleges, quoting anonymous US officials. <br></p><p> The concerns are that the stations might help Moscow spy on the US as well as improve the precision of Russian weaponry. </p><p> </p><p> Also, American lawmakers don’t like the idea of cooperating with the direct rival of the US national Global Positioning System. <br></p><p> Last week Mike D. Rogers, Republican Representative of Alabama, wrote a mailout to Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper, demanding their assessment of the Russian proposal on the question of national security. <br></p><p> Apart from the US and Russia, China and the EU are also developing satnav systems of their own, Baidu and Galileo respectively. <br></p><p> “<i>They don’t want to be reliant on the American system and believe that their systems, like GPS, will spawn other industries and applications</i>,” a former senior official in the State Department’s Office of Space and Advanced Technology told the newspaper. “<i>They feel as though they are losing a technological edge to us in an important market. Look at everything GPS has done on things like your phone and the movement of planes and ships.</i>” <br></p><p> Still, the White House so far has been opposing accusations of the US intelligence community against Russia as “It doesn't see them as a threat,” an unidentified administration official said. <br></p><p> The Obama administration is currently trying to mend Russian-American relations, damaged over Syria and asylum to former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, who revealed document-supported evidence of the US spying on unprecedented levels over global networks, including after their closest allies. <br></p><p> In October 2012 Vitaly Davydov, the former deputy of Russia’s Roskosmos space agency, revealed that Moscow needs to deploy eight monitor stations in the US for correct operation of the system in North America. He also disclosed that 19 monitor stations of American GPS positioning system were operable in Russia as of 2012. <br></p><p> On the contrary, in the latest report on the GLONASS in the US, the NYT claims that there are no GPS monitor stations in Russia whatsoever. <br></p><h2> What is GLONASS <br> </h2><p> The development of the GLONASS global navigation system began in the Soviet Union, which put the very first satellite of the system into orbit on October 12, 1982. The system was officially commissioned on September 24, 1993. <br></p><p> Despite a number of faulty rocket launches with GLONASS satellites in recent years, today the GLONASS orbit group consists of 27 satellites, of which 24 ensure global navigation and the remaining three are either in reserve or perform experimental equipment tests. <br></p><p> Russia has been deploying augmentation system stations abroad for some time already. So far there are 14 monitor stations in Russia, one in Brazil and one on Antarctica's continent at Russia’s Bellingshausen station. <br></p><p> More GLONASS stations are expected to be built in the nearest future: eight in Russia, two in Brazil, one in Australia, Cuba, Indonesia, Spain, Vietnam and an additional station in the Antarctic. <br></p><p> It was confirmed earlier in November that starting from 2014 all mobile phones and portable handheld devices with navigation functions, either imported or produced in Russia, must be equipped with GLONASS, or GLONASS and GPS microchips.  </p><p> </p><p> Today GLONASS is supported on products from world-leading handheld device producers, such as Samsung, Nokia, Apple, Motorola and others, simultaneously with GPS. This has become possible largely because leading producers of microchips, such as Qualcomm, have started producing GLONASS-enabled chipsets. <br></p><p> The introduction of a new positioning system has been welcomed by customers worldwide, because using both GLONASS and GPS systems increases the precision of positioning. European EGNOS project unites signals from both systems and gives precision positioning down to between 1.5 and 3 meters in Europe. <br></p><p> Within the next decade GLONASS is expected to replace existing satellites with new generation platforms that would enable 0.1 meter precision positioning anywhere in the world, except the polar regions of the planet. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/mars-maven-red-planet-851/</guid><title><![CDATA[Mars Mysteries: MAVEN orbiter set for launch to uncover Red Planet's secrets]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/mars-maven-red-planet-851/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/21/2a/b0/00/mars-maven-red-planet.jpg" title="Technicians work on NASA's next Mars-bound spacecraft, the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft, as it is displayed for the media at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida (Reuters / Joe Skipper)"/><pubDate>Sun, 17 Nov 2013 10:10:32 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/21/2a/b0/00/mars-maven-red-planet.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />NASA is set to launch the latest Mars orbiter to learn more about the Red Planet’s atmosphere – and probably to discover what happened to Mars billions of years ago that rendered the planet uninhabitable.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/21/2a/b0/00/mars-maven-red-planet.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Technicians work on NASA's next Mars-bound spacecraft, the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft, as it is displayed for the media at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida (Reuters / Joe Skipper)" /> <p> The Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution orbiter, or MAVEN, is to blast off powered by an Atlas 5 rocket on Monday afternoon, and will reach Mars in 10 months. The mission will cost $671 million and last for a year, though studies like this tend to often be extended, though, as long as the spacecraft is able to function and transfer data. <br></p><p> After its arrival, plans are for MAVEN to move into an elliptical orbit where it will pass through and sample the upper Martian atmosphere and also carry out ultraviolet imaging of the planet. <br><br> Maven will be the 10th orbiter the US space agency sends to Mars; three have failed. <br><br><i>‘‘No other planet, other than perhaps Earth, has held the attention of people around the world [more] than Mars,’’</i> NASA’s space science chief, John Grunsfeld, told AP. <br><br> The research is primarily aimed at finding out what happened to a potentially habitable planet with lakes, oceans, clouds, rain.  Later, sun and space apparently stripped away the Martian atmosphere and any remaining surface water. <br><br> Nowadays, the atmosphere of Mars is roughly 100 times less dense than that of Earth – and this process is carrying on even today. <br></p><p> </p><p> The idea of the study is to take measurements that determine current rates of loss of atmospheric gases into space and then extrapolate back in time to try and figure out more about when, why and how quickly they were lost, Forbes reported. <br><br> MAVEN will also serve as a communications link between Earth and the NASA rovers, Curiosity and Opportunity, that are already exploring the Red Planet, as the two orbiters currently doing the job are ageing. In fact, MAVEN's important role was reportedly the main reason why the project wasn’t shelved during the US government shutdown earlier this year. <br><br> “Mars fever” has been going on the whole year. Just a couple of weeks ago, India announced the launch of a rocket carrying a satellite towards Mars, the first interplanetary mission for the country. <br><br> In September, NASA’s Curiosity rover found water on Mars. It turned out that each cubic foot of Martian soil contains about two pints of liquid water, though the molecules are bound to other minerals in the soil.  Earlier, the Curiosity rover attempted an unsuccessful search for methane. <br><br> The Opportunity rover discovered traces of ‘drinkable’ water in June. <br></p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/drone-crashes-missile-cruiser-852/</guid><title><![CDATA[Drone crashes into Navy ship injuring 2 in California]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/drone-crashes-missile-cruiser-852/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/21/2a/c0/00/drone-crashes-missile-cruiser.jpg" title="USS Chancellorsville (AFP Photo / US NAVY)"/><pubDate>Sun, 17 Nov 2013 08:08:06 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/21/2a/c0/00/drone-crashes-missile-cruiser.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />An American drone has malfunctioned and crashed into a guided missile cruiser off the coast of Southern California, causing two injuries, say officials.

The figures for this year are a slight improvement on 2012 when the survey saw trust in the media fall to a record low of 40 percent. </p><p> However, a large amount of Americans (46 percent) believe media has become too liberal, compared to only 13 percent who regard mainstream news coverage as overly conservative. </p><p> Gallup’s statistics show the steady decline in media trust in America from 2005, with Democrats reportedly having the most confidence in American news outlets. </p><p> </p><p> <br></p><p> <br></p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/israel-saudi-iran-nuclear-846/</guid><title><![CDATA[Israel working with Saudi Arabia on Iran’s nuclear contingency plan - report]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/israel-saudi-iran-nuclear-846/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/21/2a/60/00/israel-saudi-iran-nuclear.jpg" title="Tehran's research reactor centre (AFP Photo)"/><pubDate>Sun, 17 Nov 2013 04:23:45 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/21/2a/60/00/israel-saudi-iran-nuclear.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Israel’s Mossad, along with Saudi officials, is working on contingency plans that could include an attack on Iran if its nuclear program is not curbed enough during the negotiations in Geneva this week, a new report has revealed.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/21/2a/60/00/israel-saudi-iran-nuclear.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Tehran's research reactor centre (AFP Photo)" /> <p> Both powers have expressed concern that restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program will not be enough. According to The Sunday Times newspaper, Saudi Arabia already gave Israel the green light to use its airspace in the case of an attack on Iran. </p><p> It was also revealed that the Saudis were willing to assist an Israeli attack by cooperating with the use of drones, rescue helicopters, and tanker planes. <i>“Once the Geneva agreement is signed, the military option will be back on the table. The Saudis are furious and are willing to give Israel all the help it needs,”</i> an unnamed diplomatic source told the paper. </p><p> Tehran has been negotiating sanction relief in Geneva with the P5+1 countries - consisting of the US, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and China - in exchange for assurances that it will not develop a nuclear weapon. Exact terms on offer from both sides have not been made public, but no agreement was made last weekend. The sides will sit down for a new round of talks on November 20. </p><p> Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned that lifting sanctions on Iran without demanding sufficient concessions in return will only encourage Tehran on its path to nuclear armament and lead to future conflict. </p><p> Israel has been lobbying hard against appeasement, with Netanyahu himself claiming that Iran is about to clinch <i>“the deal of the century.”</i> </p><p> On Saturday, Netanyahu spoke to French daily Le Figaro about the situation, stating that Israel and the “<i>leading states in the Arab world</i>” agree when it comes to Tehran and its nuclear capabilities. </p><p> <i>“We all think that Iran should not be allowed to have the capacities to make nuclear weapons,”</i> he said. <i>“We all think that a tougher stance should be taken by the international community. We all believe that if Iran were to have nuclear weapons, this could lead to a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, making the Middle East a nuclear tinderbox.”</i> </p><p> The prime minister’s comments were made just before French President Francois Hollande was scheduled to arrive in Israel for talks on Iran on Sunday. French objections reportedly caused an obstacle in the Iran talks last weekend. <br></p><h2> An attack would be an ‘economic catastrophe’ </h2><p> Iranian political analyst Seyed Mohammad Marandi told RT that an imminent joint attack on Iran was unlikely given the serious ramifications it could provoke for the region. </p><p> <i>“It is highly unlikely that the Saudis and Israelis would want to attack Iran because at the end of the day both countries would be losers, they would be seen as aggressors and obviously the Iranians would retaliate,”</i> Marandi told RT. </p><p> Although he consented that the Saudis and Israelis have been moving closer together lately, neither of them stood to gain from attacking Iran. </p><p> <i>“It would create an economic catastrophe for the world and only the Saudis and the Israelis would be to blame,”</i> said Marandi. </p><p> <br></p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/libya-tripoli-violence-emergency-845/</guid><title><![CDATA[State of emergency declared in Libyan capital amid fresh violence]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/libya-tripoli-violence-emergency-845/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/21/2a/50/00/tripoli-2.jpg" title="Libyan protesters gather during a demonstration calling on militiamen to vacate their headquarters in southern Tripoli on November 15, 2013.

(AFP Photo / Mahmud Turkia)" /> <p> Violence in Tripoli reignited at sundown as fighting between militia groups intensified, Ukranian medics working on the ground told ITAR-TASS. </p><p> <i>“After a break in fighting, you could hear shots being fired once again over Tripoli,”</i> one medic said. <i>“Hospitals received more dead and wounded. We haven’t seen this in Tripoli since the 2011 armed conflict.”</i> </p><p> The state of emergency was declared in the city after at least one person was killed and dozens wounded in another wave of violence on Saturday, Al Jazeera reported. The unrest began in the capital on Friday. More than 40 people were killed and another 400 were wounded. </p><p> <i>"Officially, there were more than 40 victims in the clashes in Tripoli in the past two days, but according to our data, the number of victims is much larger,”</i> one of the medics said. </p><p> Due to the situation in Tripoli, some of the streets in the city were blocked off. Local residents formed protection brigades by their houses in order to ensure safety from the militias, the medics added. </p><p> Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zidan has appealed for restraint, stating that <i>“the coming hours and days will be decisive for the history of Libya and the success of the revolution.”</i> </p><p> On Saturday, thousands of protesters gathered to remember those who died in Friday’s clashes, as the government declared three days of mourning. Zidan also demanded that all armed militias leave Tripoli <i>"without exception.” </i> </p><p> <i>"The existence of weapons outside the army and police is dangerous,"</i> he said. <i>"All armed militias need to leave Tripoli, without exception." </i> </p><p> Friday’s <a href="http://rt.com/news/libya-militia-kill-protesters-793/" target="_blank">clashes</a> began as thousands of protesters gathered in Tripoli on Friday, calling to intensify the security presence and end the militias’ rule which was established in 2011 after the uprising that ousted leader Muammar Gaddafi. The protesters marched from a downtown mosque to the headquarters of the militia waving Libyan flags and chanting slogans such as <i>"We want an army, we want police." </i> </p><p> According to a Reuters report, the militia fired an anti-aircraft cannon into the crowd. The protesters initially fled, but then returned heavily armed. The majority of stores in the city were closed following the clashes. </p><p> The main cause of the violence is Libya's weak government and armed forces which are struggling to control militias, Islamic militants, and other fighting groups which have refused to surrender their weapons two years after assisting the NATO-backed ouster of Gaddafi.  </p><p> Part of the militia was formed from local brigades of rebels, including Islamic militants who fought against Gaddafi’s government. After the fall of the leader, the government tasked the former rebel forces with maintaining security. However, the militia has not been put under state control, prompting the armed groups to act on their own agenda. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/russia-booster-rocket-energia-817/</guid><title><![CDATA[Russia starts ambitious super-heavy space rocket project]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/russia-booster-rocket-energia-817/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/21/28/90/00/6.jpg" title="PHOTO: The Energia space rocket system comprising of a launch vehicle and the Buran reusable shuttle.

(RIA Novosti / Alexander Mokletsov) 
VIDEO: Buran’s launch on November 15, 1988." /> <p> The group led by Oleg Ostapenko, the new head of Roscosmos Federal Space Agency, is set to draw up proposals on the design of a super-heavy launch vehicle capable of delivering up to 100 tonnes of payload to the baseline orbit, former Soviet minister of general machine building, Oleg Baklanov, said on Friday. <br><br> "<i>You have assumed the responsibility and dared to head the group, which is supposed to find an answer to the question how we can regain the position we demonstrated to the world with the launch of a 100-tonne spacecraft [Buran in 1988] within a few weeks,</i>" the ex-minister told Ostapenko at the event dedicated to the 25th anniversary of the flight of the Buran shuttle spacecraft.   <br><br> The new carrier rocket Angara is set to become the base for the ambitious project that could bring Russia back to its heyday of space exploration. It could be launched from the Vostochny Cosmodrome which is now being constructed in Russia’s Far East, and will replace Kazakhstan’s Baikonur as Russia’s main launchpad. </p><p> </p><p> The 1988 launch of the Energia super-heavy rocket carrying the Buran space shuttle proved the rocket was capable of delivering 100 tonnes into orbit. That was five times more than the Proton-M rocket with a 20-tonne payload, thus making it the most powerful Soviet/Russian booster rocket ever developed. <br><br> As the International Space Station is scheduled to be taken out of service around 2020, ex-minister Baklanov explained that such a powerful rocket would allow the construction of a new orbital station “<i>larger in its weight and dimensions.</i>” Also, a booster similar to the Soviet Energia would be indispensable for “<i>exploring outer space in a wise manner, working in shifts on Mars, the Moon and so on,</i>” he added. <br><br> At the same media conference, president of the Energia Rocket and Space Corporation Vitaly Lopota announced that Russia will soon need super-heavy rockets to create a shield against possible future space weapons - which means deploying into orbit massive communications satellites and electronic warfare platforms. <br></p><h2> ‘Nothing better has been created’ <br> </h2><p> On the 25th anniversary of the Buran flight, Ostapenko acknowledged that the Soviet Union’s achievements in space exploration remain an example for today’s research. <br><br><i>“Human ingenuity created the Energia-Buran system 25 years ago,”</i> Ostapenko told the audience. <i>“I am confident that events comparable by their scale are in store for us,</i>” he said. <br><br> In his speech, ex-minister Baklanov claimed that “<i>nothing new has been designed”</i> in the 25 years which have passed since the creation of the Energia-Buran system. He warned that “<i>a point of no return is very close</i>,” and said there are only years left to recuperate the space industry to the previous level and keep the groundwork. </p><p> </p><p> “<i>We have a colossal amount of work to do</i>,” Ostapenko said, pointing out that only the experience of previous generations of scientists could ensure success. <br><br> “<i>Our country has got huge potential; all we need to do is let the experienced professionals do their job the best way to ensure their self-actualization. I know we can do it. We’ve got strong support from the government, we’ve got thorough understanding of the tasks lying ahead,”</i> Ostapenko said. <br><br> Comparable to the US Space Shuttle, Buran completed only one unmanned spaceflight in 1988, as the Buran program was scrapped in 1993 following the collapse of the Soviet Union and lack of funding. <br></p><h2> Soviet shuttle ahead of its time </h2><p> The Soviet Union’s Energia/Buran exceeded the American space shuttle program by practically all capabilities, according to a report prepared by experts of the All-Russian Research Institute of Aviation Materials. The analysis is dedicated to the 25th anniversary of Buran’s only performed launch into space. <br><br> Buran could stay in orbit for 30 days, while the American shuttle had a 15-day time limit. It could deliver into orbit 30 tonnes of cargo, compared to the US shuttle’s 24 tonnes of cargo. It could carry a crew of 10 cosmonauts, while the American shuttle could carry seven astronauts. Preparation for the Energia/Buran launch at Baikonur Cosmodrome only took 15 days. However, it took one month of preparations before the US shuttle was launched from Cape Canaveral. </p><p> The Energia rocket booster could be used to launch various payloads into orbit, whereas the American shuttle’s booster was one-task. A year and a half before the Buran launch, Energia was launched with a full-scale mock-up of the Skif-DM orbital combat laser platform weighing 77 tonnes, measuring 37 meters long, and over four meters in diameter. Though the mock-up failed to reach the desired orbit and fell into the Pacific, the Energia booster did its job fine, delivering the huge space platform into intermediate orbit, 110 kilometers above the earth’s surface. <br></p><p> But the most important difference from the American model was that the Soviet spaceship could perform the flight and landing in totally automatic mode, which it brilliantly demonstrated on November 15, 1988.  </p><p> <br> Buran’s American counterpart used to land with switched-off engines, meaning it could make only one landing attempt. The Soviet spacecraft could take several tries if needed. <br><br> When Buran approached Baikonur Cosmodrome and started landing in 1988, its sensors registered too strong side winds and the robotic system sent the huge machine for another rectangular traffic pattern approach, successfully landing the spacecraft on a second try. <br><br> The Buran shuttle was designed to perform 100 flights to space, while its engines were ready to do 66 flights without replacement. During its flight, it lost just eight of its unique thermal-insulation tiles out of 38,800. <br><br> The Energia/Buran program, which cost 16.5 billion Soviet rubles, lasted 18 years and united over 1,200 industrial sites throughout the Soviet Union. </p><p> Thirty-nine principally new materials and around 230 absolutely new technologies were developed during Buran’s creation. Most of them are actively used in Russia’s aeronautical and space industries today. </p><p> <b>Watch the footage of Buran’s historic landing</b>: <br></p><p> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/KI5DPQGGzaQ" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="420"></iframe> </p><p> But the most important difference from the American model was that the Soviet spaceship could perform the flight and landing in totally automatic mode, which it brilliantly demonstrated on November 15, 1988. <br><br> Buran’s American counterpart used to land with switched-off engines, meaning it could make only one landing attempt.
